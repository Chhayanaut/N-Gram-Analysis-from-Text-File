# N-Gram-Analysis-from-Text-File
Objective The purpose of this project is to analyze a text file and extract the top 5 most frequent 2-grams (bigrams). You will learn how to load and preprocess text data, implement code to generate n-grams, count their occurrences, and display the most frequent ones.
What is an N-Gram?
An n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items (usually words) from a given text. N-grams are commonly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to capture the relationships and patterns between words.

Examples:
1-Gram (Unigram):

Text: "The quick brown fox”
Unigrams: ["The”, "quick”, "brown”, "fox”]
2-Gram (Bigram):

Text: "The quick brown fox”
Bigrams: ["The quick”, "quick brown”, "brown fox”]
3-Gram (Trigram):

Text: "The quick brown fox”
Trigrams: ["The quick brown", "quick brown fox”]
Applications of N-Grams:
Language modeling for predicting the next word in a sequence.
Text analysis for identifying common word patterns.
Sentiment analysis and keyword extraction.
In this project, we will focus on 2-grams (bigrams) to identify common consecutive word pairs in a text.
